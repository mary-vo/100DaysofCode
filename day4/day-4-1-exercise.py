######## Exercise - Odd or Even Exercise
#Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
#Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
#The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
odd_or_even = number % 2

if odd_or_even == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number.")
