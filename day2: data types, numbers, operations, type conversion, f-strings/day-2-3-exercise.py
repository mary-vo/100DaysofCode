######## Exercise - Your Life in Weeks
#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

#It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

#You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

#Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

#Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

#print(type(age))

age_as_int

years_left = 90 - age_as_int
#print(years_left)
#print(type(years_left))

months_left = years_left * 12
#print(months_left)

weeks_left = years_left * 52
#print(weeks_left)

days_left = years_left * 365
#print(days_left)

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, and {months_left} months left.")
