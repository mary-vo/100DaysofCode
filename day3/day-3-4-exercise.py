######## Exercise Pizza Order
# Instructions

# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program. 

# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill. 
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!\n")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L ")
add_pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni? Y or N ")
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
bill = 0

if size == 'S':
  bill = 15
  if add_pepperoni == 'Y':
    bill += 2

if size == 'M':
  bill = 20
  if add_pepperoni == 'Y':
    bill += 3

if size == 'L':
  bill = 25
  if add_pepperoni == 'Y':
    bill += 3

if extra_cheese == 'Y':
  bill += 1
print(f"Your final bill is: ${bill}.")


### Angela's solution
bill = 0

if size == 'S':
   bill += 15
elif size == 'M':
  bill += 20
else size == 'L':
  bill += 25

if add_pepperoni == 'Y':
  if size == 'S':
    bill += 2
  else:
    bill += 3

if add_cheese -- 'Y':
  bill += 1

print(f"You final bill is: ${bill}.")
