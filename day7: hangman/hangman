### Step 1 
import random

word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)


#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()


#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.

# Loop through chosen_word to determine whether guess letter matches any of the letters in the chosen_word
for letter in chosen_word:
  if letter == guess:
    print("Right")
  else:
    print("Wrong")




### Step 2

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
word_length=len(chosen_word)


#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.
display = []
for letter in range(word_length):
  display.append("_")
  # display += "_"  (This works as well)

# for _ in chosen_word:
#   display += "_"
  
print(display)
  
guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()


#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].
pos = []
for n in range(word_length):
  if chosen_word[n] == guess:
    pos.append(n)
# print(pos)

for n in pos:
  display[n] = guess
# print(display)

## Dr. Angela's Method
# for position in range(word_length):
#   letter = chosen_word[position]
#   print(letter)
#   if letter == guess:
#     display[position] = letter


#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.

print(display)
