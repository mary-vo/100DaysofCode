#Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

#Request for user to input their name
name = input("What is your name?\n")
#Count characters in user's name 
name_len = print(len(name))

#Another solution
print( len( input("What is your name? ") ) )
